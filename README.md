# Bostadskalkylator

Calculates the monthly rate from buying a house or a residential property given your specific inputs. The program is in Swedish.

# Why?
I built the program to learn to make a GUI in Python and making a small Windows GUI application. I have also been interested in the actual monthly cost of buying a property and therefore decided this would be a fun AND useful project. 

# How to run the program
Either you can run the bostadskalkylator.exe program in the "Bostadskalkylator/dist" folder. Your anti virus might remove this file however, so either you can mark it as safe in your anti virus program, or you can open bostadskalkylator.py in your favourite IDE and run it from there. It has some dependies such as the tkinter library which is easily downloaded with e.g. pip install.

# How it looks
Here is an image of the main screen where you can choose to either calculate rates for a house or a residental property:
